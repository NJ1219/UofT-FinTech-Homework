# Wealthsimple: Simplifying personal wealth creation through Technology
 
## Overview and Origin
 
Wealthsimple Inc. is a Canadian online investment management service focused on millennials. The firm was founded in September 2014 by Michael Katchen and Brett Huneycutt and is based in Toronto. There is an interesting story behind the origins of the company. Katchen told in an interview to Wealth Professional that the process of helping his colleagues and friends build portfolios started the idea of Wealthsimple. He said, “People want to invest – they know it’s the smart thing, but they don’t always want to hire a traditional advisor or want to do it on their own. They wanted something easy, smart and that they could trust. That’s what we’ve been trying to offer ever since.” As per the company’s cultural manual, access to financial freedom is a fundamental human right and the company's purpose is to make sure everyone has the ability to exercise that right. Financial freedom means you have the power to control your financial destiny, to do the work you love, to provide for your loved ones, and to invest in your community. It does that by making simple, sophisticated, and affordable financial products. And make sure they’re available to everyone.
 
 
 
 
As of August 2019, the firm holds over C$5 billion in assets under management and more than 175,000 clients. It is primarily owned by Power Corporation indirectly at 83.2% through investments made through their holdings in Power Financial, IGM Financial and Portag3. Wealthsimple has raised a total of CA$266.9M in funding over 7 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on May 22, 2019 from a Undisclosed round.
 
 
 
 
## Business Activities:
 
It started with an idea to provide smart, simple investing, without the high fees and account minimums associated with traditional investment management. Wealthsimple invests the money in a globally diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds through cutting-edge technology to help investors earn the best possible return, while optimizing their tax bill. This includes doing things like automatic rebalancing, dividend reinvesting, and tax loss harvesting — services that were only available to the ultra rich until now or that most people found too time-consuming and tedious to do on their own. The company mainly targets “millennials” who use technology for their everyday tasks, including financial matters.
 In the words of Michael Katchen, CEO, “We’re building the world’s most human financial company.”
 
 
  Wealthsimple puts the investor’s money into an array popular of ETFs from iShares, Vanguard, WisdomTree, VanEck, BMO and Powershares. It has three main portfolios—conservative, balanced and growth—but it also has a socially responsible investment portfolio that focuses on clean tech and low carbon, and a Halal portfolio, among other things. Investors can’t pick their portfolio—they get put into one after answering a series of risk tolerance-related questions upon signup. Wealthsimple has launched a number of new account options over the years, including RRSP, TFSA, RESP, RRIF, LIRA and, more recently, an investment account for business owners. The industry considers it the best robo-advisor for investors who like simplicity. If you have more than $100,000 in assets to invest, you’ll get access to Wealthsimple Black, which comes with a reduced fee, a financial planning session with a human advisor and access to airport lounges around the world. Deposit $500,000 to access the Wealthsimple Generation service tier, which includes in-depth financial planning with human advisors and the ability to create custom portfolios.
 
 Wealthsimple is poised at the junction of finance and technology and is making use of cutting edge technology to  service its clients and staying ahead of competition. It uses wide spectrum of applications to make this possible. For making applications and analyse data it makes use of Java, Angular JS, Ruby, Sass, Oracle, Guice, Amazon cloud and many more. To develop utilities it makes use of Postman, AWS Pipeline, tensor Flow, Periscope, Algolia, etc. For DevOps it uses Git, GitHub, Ansible, Datadog, Rollbar, RunDeck, etc. And for business operations it makes use of technologies like Slack, Zira, Zendesk, Azure Active Directory, etc.
 
## Landscape:
 
Wealthsimple operates in the domain of FinTech with the sub domain of personal finance and robo-investing. This domain has been watched with a keen eye by both the investors and the clients as well. Over the last decade there have been numerous innovations by different startups to make the financial world more accessible, easier to understand and reduce its frauds. As a result each startup has its own importance in its domain and has to remain ultra competitive in its niche territory. Wealthsimple competes with behemoths like BMO SmartFolio and RBC InvestEase. Also it has many other similar sized competitors like QuestWealth Portfolios, NEST wealth, Justwealth, wealthbar, etc.

FinTech has been fuelled by leaps made by technology in internet speeds, faster computational power in mobile devices and globalising business across borders and currencies. What kicked off with PayPal in digital payments, has been taken over by Ant Financial, Stripe and Square. Even the behemoths like Mastercard and Visa are tying up with players like Apple to stay abreast with FinTech startups. In money transfers and global remittances market worth $600 bn annually, players like XE, OFX, Remitly and TransferWise have started giving the major banks a run for their money (pun intended). Even Facebook has seen this opportunity to have started planning to launch their own product, named Libra. Even in alternate financing and personal finance, the areas dominated (or ignored) by large banks, many FinTech startups have built noticeable products and market presence.
 

 
## Results
 
Wealthsimple through its technological innovations in Finance and Marketing has simplified the domain of personal finance and that is the reason why Wealthsimple is leading in this race. It has reached a client base of over 175,000 investors and have captured more than 50% of robo advising space. As the number of investors and the Assets Under Management (AUM) increase and reach a critical mass, Wealthsimple would look towards an exponential growth. As it already has its offices in Canada, US and UK, other nations like Germany, Australia, etc could be on its radar. These countries share many common elements in their business models and spending patterns. With an exciting mix of talent and availability of funds, Wealthsimple is a startup to look forward to with much anticipation.
 
 
## Recommendations
 
Wealthsimple would want more money in the hands of its clients which they can invest with it. The amount of money available to a person for investing, is the leftover from taxes and expenses. Wealthsimple made a good move in acquiring SimpleTax (Sept 2019) to take care of one part of the equation. The other and more important part is to track a person’s expenses. Access to spending patterns can give great insights into future expenses and possibility of savings opportunties. For example, a person spending on baby products would be a good target to pitch for an RESP. Similarly, a person starting a new home mortgage would look to spend on home improvement products and possibly look for a life insurance policy also. Such insights from the spending pattern, helped by machine learning, would help robo-advisors paint a better and more realistic picture in front of their clients. Through a look into the spending patterns, possible avenues of savings could be tapped. This would increase the investment funds and thereby, revenues to Wealthsimple.
 
To achieve this, Wealthsimple could develop a product on their own and import a customer’s spending pattern through their credit/ debit card statements. An alternative could be to acquire a company that is already invested into tracking customer’s spending patterns like Financeit or Borrowell and likes. This would complete the equation for Wealthsimple.
 
Competitors like RBC Investease and BMO SmartFolio or QuestWealth have an edge in this regard. In the longer run, the customer would look into one stop shop for all their financial needs like spending, trading and investing. As the banks have a natural advantage in this regard, Wealthsimple would require using its agility and innovation to take the game away from its competitors. Even though, at the last count, Wealthsimple has acquired a lion’s share of 72% in the digital financial advice industry.
 
Wealthsimple uses data analytics to tune its AIML based robo advisors and more data would certainly help in better decisions. Keep an eye on this exciting organisation and more good news from it are coming in the near future.
